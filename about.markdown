I'm a dad of two beautiful children, Julia and Eric, husband of a wonderful wife, Shirley and a passionate software engineer.

As a dad I like to spend my time with my children and teach them to live the life. I still didn't discover if I teach the same
amount as I learn everyday with my kids.

As a software engineer, I had the opportunity to work on so many great projects during my career. I've worked on green projects to
small startup and I also had the opportunity to work on big enterprise projects. I've working with ruby, python, go, java and javascript
for the past 10 years.

In my spare time I like to play video games, play guitar and cook my own food. I also like to experiment and get to know new beers.
